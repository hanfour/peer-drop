        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

        <p>PeerDrop ("we", "our", or "the app") is a peer-to-peer communication app that enables direct device-to-device file transfer, messaging, and voice calls over your local network. Your privacy is fundamental to how PeerDrop is designed.</p>

        <h2>Our Core Principle</h2>
        <p>PeerDrop is built around a simple principle: <strong>your data stays on your devices</strong>. We do not operate any servers, cloud storage, or analytics services. All communication happens directly between devices on your local network.</p>

        <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.</li>
            <li>We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks.</li>
            <li>We do not access your contacts, location, or browsing history.</li>
            <li>We have no user accounts, registration, or sign-in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
        <p>The following data is stored exclusively on your device and never leaves it unless you explicitly share it with a connected peer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chat messages:</strong> Encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored in the app's sandboxed Documents directory.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared media:</strong> Photos, videos, and voice messages you send or receive are encrypted and stored locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Saved devices:</strong> Device names and identifiers of peers you choose to save for quick reconnection.</li>
            <li><strong>Display name:</strong> The name you set to identify yourself to other peers.</li>
            <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> App settings such as feature toggles and display preferences, stored in UserDefaults.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Network Communication</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local network only:</strong> PeerDrop discovers nearby devices using Bonjour (mDNS) on your local Wi-Fi network. No internet connection is required.</li>
            <li><strong>Encrypted connections:</strong> All peer-to-peer connections use TLS encryption. Certificate fingerprints are displayed for trust-on-first-use verification.</li>
            <li><strong>No external servers:</strong> Messages, files, and voice calls are transmitted directly between devices. No data passes through our servers or any third-party service.</li>
            <li><strong>WebRTC:</strong> Voice calls use WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer audio. No STUN/TURN servers are used; connections are established directly on the local network.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>PeerDrop requests the following permissions, each used solely for the stated purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Network:</strong> To discover and connect to nearby devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> To enable voice calls and voice message recording.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To capture photos for sharing in chats.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To select photos and videos for sharing in chats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All stored chat data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM.</li>
            <li>Encryption keys are derived from your device and stored in the iOS Keychain.</li>
            <li>Network connections use TLS 1.2 or higher with ephemeral P-256 key pairs.</li>
            <li>File integrity is verified using SHA-256 hashes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all app data at any time by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting individual chat histories within the app.</li>
            <li>Removing saved devices from your library.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app, which removes all locally stored data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>PeerDrop does not knowingly collect any data from children. Since the app does not collect any personal data from any user, it is compliant with COPPA and similar regulations.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>PeerDrop does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only third-party dependency is the open-source WebRTC framework, which is used solely for local peer-to-peer audio communication.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
