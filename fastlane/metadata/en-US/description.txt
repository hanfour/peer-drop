PeerDrop lets you share files, chat, and make voice calls directly between devices on your local network — no internet, no cloud, no accounts required.

KEY FEATURES

- Direct File Transfer: Send photos, videos, documents, and any file type directly to nearby devices. Files are chunked and verified with SHA-256 hashes for integrity.

- Encrypted Chat: Send text messages, photos, videos, and voice messages with end-to-end encryption. All chat history is stored locally and encrypted with AES-256-GCM.

- Voice Calls: Make crystal-clear voice calls using WebRTC, fully integrated with iOS CallKit for a native calling experience.

- Device Discovery: Automatically find nearby devices on your Wi-Fi network using Bonjour. Or connect manually by IP address.

- Multi-Connection: Connect to up to 5 devices simultaneously. Each connection has independent chat, file transfer, and voice call capabilities.

- Device Library: Save frequently connected devices for quick reconnection. Organize them into groups.

- Privacy First: No servers, no accounts, no tracking. Everything stays between your devices. All connections use TLS encryption with trust-on-first-use verification.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Open PeerDrop on two devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network
2. Devices discover each other automatically
3. Tap to connect — the receiving device approves the connection
4. Start sharing files, chatting, or making voice calls
